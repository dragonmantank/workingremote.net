# Collaboration

One of the biggest reasons that remote work fails is because of failures to properly collaborate and communicate with and between employees. 

In a traditional office environment, a shocking number of decisions can be made outside of a person's office or during a meeting. There are many times where an employee is stuck and just talking with another employee on their team, and a decision that can affect an entire project gets decided on. These types of "water cooler decisions" can be useful, but they show a large gap in communication. 

When employees move out of the office, even if the move is temporary, these types of situations can lead to feelings of frustration from the remote employees. 

Some helpful tips for enhancing collaboration and communication are:

<ul>
    <li>All meetings should be video meetings, with cameras turned on</li>
    <li>All meetings should be recorded, and the archived video easily accessible</li>
    <li>All meetings should have an agenda, with a link to the video</li>
    <li>Discussions about projects or work-items should be done in a shared medium, like a team Slack channel</li>
</ul>

## Online Meetings

When it comes to doing remote work, having meetings where the video is on and people can see each other helps with various communication queues everyone has. We can gauge attentiveness and reactions much better when we can see the people that we are talking to.
