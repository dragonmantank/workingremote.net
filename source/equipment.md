# Equipment

## Audio/Video

We all know the pains of having to call into a meeting and deal with conference calls. While we cannot help with Bob and his inability to push the mute button on his phone, there are some bits of hardware that we can recommend that will make your video conference calls much more enjoyable.

### Webcams

Webcams are a must with remote employees. There are visual queues you miss during meetings and quick get-togethers when no one is using a camera.

There is nothing saying you need to spend a bunch of money on a webcam. Most Apple laptops have very good webcams built in, while PC laptops tend to be hit or miss. Just because you spent lots of money on a laptop does not meant you get a good webcam.

If you are going to upgrade, getting a 1080p camera is what I would recommend shooting for. The quality afforded by a good 1080p camera gives you a great amount of flexibility to downgrade the quality to 720p or lower when the bandwidth requires it, but higher quality videos will visually look better. Logitech makes some cameras at a variety of price-points. 

The Logitech C922 Webcam is an excellent, easy-to-use webcam for desktops, laptops that have poor cameras, or laptop cameras in a poor location (no one really wants to look up your nose during a meeting). It also comes with Logitech software that give you a decent amount of control over the camera if you are on Windows. 

<a href="https://mattstauffer.com/blog/setting-up-your-webcam-lights-and-audio-for-remote-work-podcasting-videos-and-streaming/">Matt Stauffer recommends</a> the Logitech C930e or the Logitech C920s, which are also great cameras, and come in at a cheaper price than the C922, but most of these cameras are now being sold by third parties on Amazon so the cost can fluctuate a bit.
