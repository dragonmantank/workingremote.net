Backend and content for WorkingRemote.net

This repo will house all the content and code for the website. For the moment, please submit a Github issue with a link to the article/twitter thread/whatever that you think will be useful for people.

If you would like to write something directly, feel free to either post to your personal blog and submit a link, or create a github issue with the content in Markdown form and I'll get it worked in once the content backend is set up.

Feel free to also provide any other feedback or help, this website is open source under the GPL v3.
